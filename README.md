### Number of Roles to be Filled
The ultimate number of roles that will need to be filled for the "silver tsunami" is quite large.  The good news is that all employees elibible for retirement will not retire at once.  For example, the number of eligibile retirees with birthdays in 1952 will be some of the first to retire.  If those with birthdays in 1952 all retire in the same year, that will only be a total of 16,981 employees to replace for that year. That is still a large number but compared to the grand total of employees retiring it is just a fraction.  Please see the table below that shows the number of retirement ready employees with birthdays from 01-01-1952 to 12-31-1952 by title:

The above table is just the number or retirement ready employees with birthdays in 1952.  The next table will show the full amount of employees ready to retire that have birthdays between 01-01-1952 and 12-31-1955 by title.  This table will show much larger numbers than the first.  The good news is, retirement will happen in waves and not all at once.  Please see table below for complete retirement ready list.
